# Crawler
Searching robot
This project was made for the course of Java study of Caltech University: CS11 Java (Section 3) - Spring 2017-2018

Goals
In this project, you was written a rudimentary web crawler. This crawler will automatically download web pages from the internet, search for new links within those pages, and repeat. This crawler will be just about the simplest one imaginable: it will simply look for new URLs (web page locations) on each page, collect them and print them out at the end. More sophisticated web crawlers are used to do things like index the Internet's content or scavenge for email addresses to spam; if you've ever used a search engine, you've queried against the data that a web crawler generated.
